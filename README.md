# Generate-Images-with-DALL-E-2-and-OpenAI-API

## Project's Objective

OpenAI describes DALL·E 2 as "an AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language."  It is an oustanding tool, which allows creating images on the fly.

Objective of this project is to test DALL·E 2 in generating images, based on text prompts and also to create variations of the generated image.

## Image Generated:
With the prompt "Pixar style 3D render of a baby tucan, high resolution", the following image was generated:
<p align="left">
  <img width="631" height="188" src="images/image.jpg">
</p>

Creating variations of the generated image above:
<p align="left">
  <img width="631" height="188" src="images/image_0.jpg"><img width="631" height="188" src="images/image_1.jpg"><img width="631" height="188" src="images/image_2.jpg">
</p>
